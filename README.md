A full-stack application built following the [official T3 stack tutorial](https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4).

A few things I implemented on top of what the tutorial covered:

- better UI with hover styling on posts
- post 'cards' are clickable even though they nest Next.js links to different routes

The [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction) out-of-the-box (can be) comprised of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs)

We used [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication.

The site is live [here](https://chirp-tutorial-brown.vercel.app/). Join the fun!
