/**
 * YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO EDIT THIS FILE, UNLESS:
 * 1. You want to modify request context (see Part 1).
 * NOTE : Editing this file to embed the auth state into `ctx` so we can determine if a user is logged in and who they are.
 *  NOTE: We wouldn't have to do this if we just set up with NextAuth. But, since we're using Clerk, we're doing things this way.
 * 2. You want to create a new middleware or type of procedure (see Part 3).
 *  NOTE: we are also creating a software layer before our main back-end process (i.e., middleware) to enforce that a user is authenticated before any posting is allowed. See `enforceUserIsAuthed` for details.
 *
 * TL;DR - This is where all the tRPC server stuff is created and plugged in. The pieces you will
 * need to use are documented accordingly near the end.
